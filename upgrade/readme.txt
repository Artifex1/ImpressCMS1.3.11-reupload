Upgrade script instructions
--------------------------------------------
See below the procedures to migrate your XOOPS 2.0.x or ImpressCMS site to the newest version of ImpressCMS.
We strongly recommend that you follow all the steps faithfully so your site is updated in a secure manner.

BEWARE : do not upgrade your production site without making backups first! The upgrade procedure is
part of the tests of a new release, but it is impossible for us to test all different server configurations
and site setups, so a small risk still exists. Always test a site upgrade on a copy of your site.
